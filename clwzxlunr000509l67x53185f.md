In LESS CSS, the concept of extending classes allows you to reuse styles from one class in another. This helps in reducing redundancy and maintaining cleaner code. Here’s a step-by-step guide and examples to help you understand how to extend classes in LESS CSS.

#### What is LESS CSS?

LESS is a CSS pre-processor that extends the capabilities of CSS with features like variables, nesting, mixins, and extending. It helps to write more maintainable and reusable CSS.

#### Why Use Extend?

Extend is useful for:

* Reusing styles without duplicating code.
    
* Keeping your CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    
* Making it easier to update styles across multiple selectors.
    

#### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for extending a class in LESS is:

```less
.selector:extend(.other-selector);
```

### Examples

Let's walk through some examples to understand how extending classes works in LESS.

#### Example 1: Basic Extension

Suppose we have two classes, `.box` and `.red-box`. We want `.red-box` to have all the styles of `.box` plus some additional styles.

```less
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}

.red-box {
  &:extend(.box);
  background-color: red;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `.box` defines basic styles: width, height, and border.
    
* `.red-box` extends `.box`, inheriting its styles, and adds a background color.
    

#### Example 2: Extending Multiple Classes

You can also extend multiple classes at once. Here’s how:

```less
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}

.round {
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.red-box {
  &:extend(.box);
  &:extend(.round);
  background-color: red;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `.red-box` extends both `.box` and `.round`, inheriting their styles.
    

#### Example 3: Extending Placeholder Selectors

LESS allows you to create placeholder selectors (which start with `%`). These selectors are meant to be extended but do not produce any CSS on their own.

```less
%box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}

.red-box {
  &:extend(%box);
  background-color: red;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `%box` is a placeholder selector with styles.
    
* `.red-box` extends `%box` and adds a background color. `%box` itself does not appear in the compiled CSS.
    

### Benefits of Using Extend

* **Code Reusability:** Extend allows you to reuse existing styles without duplicating code.
    
* **Maintainability:** Changes to the base class automatically propagate to the extended classes.
    
* **Cleaner CSS:** Less repetition results in cleaner, more readable CSS.
    

### Conclusion

Extending classes in LESS CSS is a powerful feature that promotes code reuse and maintainability. By using `:extend`, you can inherit styles from other classes, reducing redundancy and making your CSS more efficient.

### Example in Action

Here’s a simple HTML and LESS example demonstrating class extension:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Extend Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="red-box"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

```less
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}

.round {
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.red-box {
  &:extend(.box);
  &:extend(.round);
  background-color: red;
}
```

**Result:**

* The first `<div>` has the styles from `.box`.
    
* The second `<div>` has the combined styles of `.box` and `.round` with an additional red background.
    

These examples and explanations, will help you as a beginner to be able to grasp the concept of extending classes in LESS CSS and apply it effectively in your projects.

## Domain and Hosting

Once you've settled on your niche, it's time to get your domain and hosting sorted. These are the foundations of your WordPress blog.

* **Choosing a Domain**: Your domain name is your blog's address on the internet. It should be relevant to your niche and easy to remember. Consider using keywords that reflect your blog's content.
    
* **Selecting Hosting**: Hosting is where your blog's files and data will be stored. Opt for a reliable hosting provider that offers good speed, uptime, and customer support.

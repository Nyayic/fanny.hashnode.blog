 **3. Editor Configurations**

* Adjust tab size, indentation, word wrap, and other editor-specific configurations according to your preference.
    

 **4. Customizing Themes**

* Choose a theme that suits your taste and enhances readability during coding sessions.
    

 **5. Keyboard Shortcuts**

* Customize or learn existing keyboard shortcuts to expedite your workflow.
    

 **6. IntelliSense**

* Finetune IntelliSense settings to better assist you while writing code.
    

## Optimizing VS Code Performance

To ensure smooth performance while working on web development projects, consider the following tips:

* **Keep Extensions Minimal:** Install only necessary extensions to avoid clutter and potential performance degradation.
    
* **Regular Updates:** Keep Visual Studio Code and extensions up to date to benefit from bug fixes and performance enhancements.
    
* **Workspace Isolation:** Use workspaces to isolate projects, preventing interference between different project configurations.

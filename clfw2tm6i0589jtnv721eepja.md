Open source projects are software projects that are developed, tested, and distributed by a community of developers and creators who work collaboratively to improve the software.

Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way to develop your coding skills, make connections with other developers, and gain experience working on real-world projects.   
Let us walk through the steps of how to contribute to open-source projects for absolute beginners.

## Step 1: Choose a project

The first step in contributing to open-source projects is to choose a project that you're interested in. So you are wondering, where can I find these projects? 

You can find the open source by browsing projects on Codetriage, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Look for projects that match your interests and skills, and read through their documentation and code to get a sense of what the project does and how it works. 

Go the extra mile to check if the project has a list of issues that need help. These issues can be a good starting point for new contributors.

## Step 2: Understand the project

Once you've chosen a project, take the time to understand it fully. Read through the project's documentation, including its README file and any other documentation it has. 

This will give you a whole idea about the project and will help you understand how the project works, its goals, and its requirements. If you're unsure about anything, reach out to the project's maintainers or community members for clarification.

## Step 3: Set up your development environment

Before you can start contributing to a project, you'll need to set up your development environment. This will vary depending on the project, but most projects have documentation on how to set up your development environment. 

Make sure you follow the instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you run into any issues.

## Step 4: Find an issue to work on

Sometimes, you might find a project already has a list of issues, look through them to find one that you're interested in working on. 

Choose an issue that matches your skills and experience level. If you're new to the project, look for issues labeled as "good first issues" or "help wanted." These are issues that are relatively easy to fix and are a good starting point for new contributors.

## Step 5: Fork the project

Once you've found an issue to work on, fork the project's repository. This will create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account. 

You can clone it to your computer  and make changes to your copy of the project

## Step 6: Make changes

When you start making changes, it is very important to follow the project's coding conventions and guidelines.

Remember that you're working with a community of developers. Be respectful of other people's codes and contributions, and make sure to follow the project's guidelines and conventions. 

If you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification from the project's maintainers or community members.

## Step 7: Create a pull request

When you're ready to submit your changes, create a pull request. This tells the project's maintainers that you have changes you'd like them to consider. 

Be sure to include a detailed description of your changes and the problem they solve. It's also a good idea to reference the issue you're addressing in your pull request.

## Step 8: Address feedback

The project's maintainers may review your pull request and provide feedback. Be sure to address any feedback they give you and make the necessary changes to your code. 

Once your changes are accepted, they'll be merged into the project's codebase.

## Step 9: Keep contributing

Congratulations! You've made your first contribution to an open-source project. Don't stop there, though. Continue to contribute to the project by fixing more issues, adding new features, and helping other contributors. 

Open source projects thrive on community contributions, and your continued contributions will help make the project better for everyone.

Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way to develop your coding skills, make connections with other developers, and gain experience working on real-world projects. 

You can start contributing to open-source projects and become an active member of the open-source community. Also, remember to choose a project that matches your interests and skills, and understand the project's goals and requirements.

Contributing to open-source projects takes time and effort, but it's a rewarding experience that can help you grow as a developer and make a meaningful contribution to the software community.
